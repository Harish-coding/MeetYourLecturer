# MeetYourLecturer

The app was developed on APEX, with the training knowledge from my internship at Almoayyed Computers Middle East.  The app is designed to make scheduling appointments with your lecturers easier. Once the request for appointment is made (provided that the lecturer is already not booked for the time slot), the lecturer will login in to either approve or reject the appointment. The app ustilises APEX workflow to send automated email to student based on the approval outcome. Please import the file to APEX Web to run the application.
